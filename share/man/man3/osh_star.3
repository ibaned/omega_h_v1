.SH NAME
osh_star \-  Get the connectivity across other entities (1) 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
unsigned const* osh_star(osh_t m, unsigned low_dim, unsigned high_dim)
.fi
Returns a read-only array describing connectivity
from the low dimension across the higher one
and back to the low dimension, on this MPI rank.
Works together with osh_star_offs().
The storage format is similar to osh_up() and osh_up_offs().

The information is limited to this MPI rank.
Specifically, if the mesh is not ghosted, entities
at the partition boundary will have incomplete information.

In CUDA mode, the array is in device memory.

.SH EXAMPLES ARE

osh_star(m, 0, 1) - vertices-to-vertices across edges

osh_star(m, 0, 2) - vertices-to-vertices across triangles

osh_star(m, 1, 3) - edges-to-edges across tetrahedra
