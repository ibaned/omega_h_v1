.SH NAME
osh_new_global \-  Create a global numbering of entities 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
unsigned long* osh_new_global(osh_t m, unsigned dim)
.fi
This should only be used in conjunction with
osh_new() to create a mesh manually in parallel.
The internally allocated array of global numbers is returned,
and should be filled in after this call and before
any subsequent API calls.

The array is returned rather than received to
allow omega_h to use its own allocators.

In CUDA mode, the array is in device memory.
