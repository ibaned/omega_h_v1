.SH NAME
osh_own_id \-  Get the owning MPI ranks of entities. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
unsigned const* osh_own_id(osh_t m, unsigned dim)
.fi
Returns a read-only array containing the owner
local index for each entity of a given dimension.
This ownership is often determined by omega_h
and affects the behavior of osh_accumulate_to_owner()
and osh_conform().
The indices listed here are for the owner MPI
rank, so they are usually only useful when transmitted
to the owner rank.

In CUDA mode, the array is in device memory.

.SH INPUT PARAMETERS
.PD 0
.TP
.B m 
- mesh handle
.PD 1
.PD 0
.TP
.B dim 
- the dimension of entities to inquire about
.PD 1
