.SH NAME
osh_adapt \-  Adapts the mesh to a given size field. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
unsigned osh_adapt(osh_t m,
    double size_ratio_floor,
    double good_element_quality,
    unsigned nsliver_layers,
    unsigned max_passes)
.fi
The size field is currently a single value per vertex
describing the desired length of mesh edges at that location,
it must be called "adapt_size".
The return value will be zero if no connectivity changes are made.

.TP
.B m 
- The mesh object.
.PD 1
.PD 0
.TP
.B size_quality_floor 
- Range [0.0 - 0.5], default 1/3. Edges shorter than this
times their desired size will attempt coarsening.

.B good_element_quality 
- Range [0.0 - 1.0], default 0.3. No elements will lower
quality will be created, and existing elements with
lower quality will attempt shape correction.

.B nsliver_layers 
- Range [0 - ?], default 4. Number of layers of elements around
a sliver to consider for correction.

.B max_passes 
- Range [1 - 100], default 50. Maximum number of modification passes
before the program fails.
