.SH NAME
osh_up \-  Get the connectivity from low dimension to high (1) 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
unsigned const* osh_up(osh_t m, unsigned low_dim, unsigned high_dim)
.fi
Returns a read-only array describing connectivity
from the low dimension to the higher one, on this MPI rank.
Works together with osh_up_offs().

Similar to osh_down(), upward adjacencies are organized
by lower entities, for each lower entity there
are contiguous entries pointing to higher entities.
However, the number of entries per lower entity is variable
so there is a separate array of offsets describing where
they start and stop.
For example, from vertices to triangles, the array
would be of size (osh_offs(m,0,2)[osh_count(m,0)]),
and the entries

.nf
unsigned const* offs = osh_up_offs(m,0,2);
unsigned const* up = osh_up(m,0,2);
for (unsigned j = offs[i]; j < offs[i + 1]; ++j)
up[j];
.fi


contain the vertex indices of triangle (i).
All indices are local to the MPI rank.

In CUDA mode, the array is in device memory.
