.SH NAME
osh_down \-  Get the connectivity from high dimension to low 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
unsigned const* osh_down(osh_t m, unsigned high_dim, unsigned low_dim)
.fi
Returns a read-only array describing connectivity
from the high dimension to the lower one, on this MPI rank.

The array is organized by higher entity,
and for each higher entity there are contiguous
entries pointing to lower entities.
For example, from triangles to vertices, the array
would be of size (3 * osh_count(m, 2)), and the entries

.nf
unsigned const* down = osh_down(m, 2, 0);
for (unsigned j = i * 3; j < (i + 1) * 3; ++j)
down[j];
.fi


contain the vertex indices of triangle (i).
All indices are local to the MPI rank.
