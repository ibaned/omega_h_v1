.SH NAME
osh_new_label \-  Create an integer label unless it exists 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
unsigned* osh_new_label(osh_t m, unsigned dim, char const* name, unsigned ncomps)
.fi
If a label with this name does not exist over entities
of the given dimension, one will be created.
Otherwise this is equivalent to osh_get_label().
The internally allocated array of data is returned,
and can be filled in after this call.
The components for each entity are contiguous.

The array is returned rather than received to
allow omega_h to use its own allocators.

In CUDA mode, the array is in device memory.
