   SIAM journal on computing 15.4 (1986): 1036-1053.

   instead of random values at the vertices, we use "goodness" values.
   these values are usually the quality of mesh cavities, which
   have the similar desirable property that there are no
   long paths in the graph with monotonically increasing goodness.
   (the algorithm's iteration count is proportional to the length
    of the longest such path). */
