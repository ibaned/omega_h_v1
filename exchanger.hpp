/* The exchanger is designed to send information
   from many small sources to many small destinations.
   It is a symmetric multi-stage pipeline as follows.

   1) expand source array to input array.
      the offsets should specify a one-to-many
      mapping from source items to input items.

   2) shuffle the input array such that items are
      sorted by destination rank
      (the result is the sent array)

   3) use comm_exch_* to exchange the sent array data,
      resulting in a source-rank-sorted received array

   4) shuffle the received array, resulting in the
      "output" array which is sorted by destination
      item

   5) maintain the one-to-many mapping between destination
      items and output items, this is just offered to
      the user for higher-level purposes

   The above five stages can be reversed, thus the symmetric
   nature of the exchanger.
   For now, the exchanger is constructed in a push-based
   fashion, by giving, for each *input* item, the
   global ID (rank and local id) of the *destination* item,
   and optionally the offsets defining the
   source to input mapping.
