  osh_adapt - Adapts the mesh to a given size field.

   The size field is currently a single value per vertex
   describing the desired length of mesh edges at that location,
   it must be called "adapt_size".
   The return value will be zero if no connectivity changes are made.

  Input Parameters:
+ m - The mesh object.
. size_quality_floor - Range [0.0 - 0.5], default 1/3. Edges shorter than this
                       times their desired size will attempt coarsening.
. good_element_quality - Range [0.0 - 1.0], default 0.3. No elements will lower
                         quality will be created, and existing elements with
                         lower quality will attempt shape correction.
. nsliver_layers - Range [0 - ?], default 4. Number of layers of elements around
                   a sliver to consider for correction.
- max_passes - Range [1 - 100], default 50. Maximum number of modification passes
               before the program fails.

/*@
  osh_identity_size - Compute the "current" size field.

  This function computes a size field which,
  when used by osh_adapt(), will cause little to no
  change in the mesh edge lengths.
  To be precise, it computes at each vertex the
  length of the longest adjacent edge.

  There are several reasons why this might be useful.
  First, one can use this to limit adaptation to
  just shape correction, and improve the quality of
  elements while maintaining resolution.

  One can also compute this field before Langrangian
  mesh motion (moving vertices) and later use osh_adapt
  to restore the previous resolution while roughly
  maintaining new vertex locations.

  Finally, the identity size field may be used as the
  starting point for the final size field, for example
  it may be divided by some factor in order to increase
  resolution throughout by that factor, even if the
  initial resolution was not uniform.

  Input Parameters:
+ m - mesh handle
- name - the name used for the resulting field
