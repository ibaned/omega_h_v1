/* some optimization here due to the relatively
   high cost of these operations.
   first, nverts_wanted is either 2 or 3.
   that is because reflect_down is only
   used to derive intermediate downward adjacencies,
   and we always have the n->0 adjacency, so it must
   be one of:
     3->2
     3->1
     2->1
   and for d=2, d=1, the number of vertices of a simplex
   is n=3, n=2, respectively.

TODO: consolidate this with find_by_verts.h
