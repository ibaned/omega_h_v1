 * filled are referred to as domain entities (dom_dim),
 * and the entities that are getting new vertices placed
 * in their centers (splitting) are source entities.
 * each domain entity examines its adjacent source
 * entities.
 * at most one of these will actually be splitting,
 * indicated by offset_of_srcs.
 * domain entities adjacent to splitting sources
 * are marked (offset_of_doms), and the relative
 * direction and new vertex of the adjacent source
 * are recorded (direction_of_doms, vert_of_doms).
